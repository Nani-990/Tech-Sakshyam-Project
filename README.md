# **📌 README.md for AI Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System**  

# 🎯 AI Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System  

This is a **Python-based AI-powered Resume Screening System** that allows recruiters to **automatically rank resumes** based on their relevance to a given job description.  

The application is built using **Streamlit** for the UI and leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques like **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to analyze resumes.

## 🚀 **Features**  

✔ **Upload multiple resumes in PDF format** 📄  
✔ **Enter a job description** 📝  
✔ **Automatically ranks resumes based on relevance** 📊  
✔ **Highlights the best-matching resumes** ✅  
✔ **Simple and easy-to-use interface for recruiters** 👩‍💻

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**  

🔹 **Python** 🐍 – Core programming language  
🔹 **Streamlit** – Interactive UI for easy usability  
🔹 **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library for text analysis  
🔹 **PyPDF2** – Extracts text from PDF resumes  
🔹 **Pandas** – Data handling and analysis  

---

## 📦 **Installation Guide**  

Since this application runs **without a virtual environment** and is executed via **Jupyter Notebook**, follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Install Required Libraries**  
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn PyPDF2
```

### **2️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook**  
Run the command:  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open the `resume_screening.ipynb` file.

---

## ▶ **Running the Application**  

Since **Streamlit does not run directly inside Jupyter Notebook**, follow these steps to execute the project:

### **1️⃣ Convert Jupyter Notebook to Python Script**  
Run the following command inside Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script resume_screening.ipynb
```
This will generate `resume_screening.py`.

### **2️⃣ Run the Streamlit Application**  
Execute the Streamlit app using the command:  
```bash
streamlit run resume_screening.py
```

---

## 🛠 **How It Works**  

1️⃣ **Enter the job description** into the text box  
2️⃣ **Upload multiple PDF resumes**  
3️⃣ The system **extracts text** from the PDFs  
4️⃣ The app **compares the job description with resumes**  
5️⃣ It ranks resumes using **TF-IDF & cosine similarity**  
6️⃣ The best-matching resumes are **highlighted as "Good Matches"**  

---

## 📊 **Algorithm Explanation**  

🔹 **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** – Used to convert textual data into numerical vectors.  
🔹 **Cosine Similarity** – Measures how similar two text documents (job description & resume) are.  
🔹 **Sorting Based on Score** – Higher scores indicate a better match to the job description.  

## 📜 **Example Output**  

### **Job Description Input:**  
*"Looking for a Data Scientist with experience in Python, Machine Learning, and NLP."*  

### **Ranked Resumes:**  

| Resume File      | Similarity Score | Match Status  |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| resume_1.pdf   | 0.89           | ✅ Good Match |
| resume_2.pdf   | 0.76           | ✅ Good Match |
| resume_3.pdf   | 0.40           | ❌ Not a Match |
